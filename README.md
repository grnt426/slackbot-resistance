4. From the command line, run the JAR like so: 
    java -jar (JAR name) (bot API key) (bot name)
    * For (JAR name), use the path to the JAR you downloaded in step 3.
    * Use the API Key you obtained from step 2 for (bot API key)
    * For (bot name), use the name you gave to the bot when setting up the integration.
5. Invite the bot to a channel and you should be able to use it. Say its name for more info.    

## Heroku Installation
Requires:
* A [Slack](https://slack.com) account
* A free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account
* Permission to set up integrations in Slack

Please note that, if you are using the free Heroku account, the app will ocassionally go to sleep and the bot will
stop responding to you. Visit the URL for your Heroku app to wake it up. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR CURRENT GAME! There's no way to keep it awake 24/7 without paying.
It may be easier to just run it yourself as described in the "Running It" section.
